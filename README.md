# TR

Powering up my new blog or laboratory, you can see it live [here](https://tr.techsquad.rocks/blog), I will cover how
this is deployed to production in my [usual blog](https://techsquad.rocks) since there are many interesting things being
used here (k3s on ARM64, argocd, tekton, etc), so you will also learn how to easily build and run your project in
kubernetes, I also plan to explore some Web3 topics here...

# Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Start the dev PG instance `docker-compose up -d`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
