### **Introduction**
<br />

Hello there,

I will be working in some courses that will be available here through GitHub Sponsors, but I wanted to explain what you
will get by sponsoring me and also how it works on a high level, by becoming a sponsor you will get lifetime access to
the courses, these courses will be highly practical with explanations and enough theory to understand the topic at hand, 
everything else will be open source (code examples, etc), by supporting me you will receive more content in return
ðŸ˜„ 
<br />

Upcoming courses:
* Docker: Understand docker from scratch.
* Kubernetes: Deploy your apps and manage clusters, autoscale your apps and best practices.
* Terraform: Code your infrastructure and automate it through GitHub and Atlantis.
* GitHub Actions: Configure your pipelines to build, test and deploy your applications in Kubernetes.
* Observability: Learn how to deploy and use Prometheus and Grafana to observe and monitor your apps, create dashboards
  and also meaningful alerts.

I expect to officially launch the Docker course in about a month from now, the other courses might start after that,
also by joining you will receive an invite to Discord/Slack (to be defined) so you can connect with me and ask me any
question that you might have. 

<br />

Thank you ðŸ’¥

<br />

### **But wait... how does it work?**

I mentioned everything was going to be open-source even this blog or learning platform, wouldn't we be able to just read
the articles since they are plaintext in the repository? [tr](https://github.com/kainlite/tr), and that would be a fair
question, introducing "Cloak", the sponsored content will be in fact in the repository readable by anyone, but encrypted
and only rendered to those who sign in via GitHub (because I need to know your username) and also make sure you are in
fact a sponsor ðŸ¥². 

With just a few calls to this module we can safely encrypt and decrypt the content of a given page, for example this is
what it looks like:
<br />

```elixir
%{
  title: "Master Docker from scratch (coming soon...)",
  author: "Gabriel Garrido",
  description: "This will be a short course to master docker on linux, it will consist of 3 parts and the first
  sponsored content posted here (video and text)",
  tags: ~w(docker courses),
  published: true,
  image: "docker-logo.svg",
  sponsored: true,
  video: "AQpBRVMuR0NNLlYxTJxSRfOfhl7jf3JuF/iCr59Ft4wVtu0td5HG//On8X1qfAwkUvdCST8aXPtgFedBaVfkKIATz1TgZNoe9R17SdiB066J",
  encrypted_content: "AQpBRVMuR0NNLlYxJJUZ6S+zhjv81zDHqUMSo3g5JkVGsTchQlKfB7fZfxg//hMIyX/XsUCygsFRr+MFlpw0vne8FxO2Si6jshOw8lKDMNvoXioHNmgQeozlahuIce0+D0NCh5vFFsbJIi//TTpac1coUdiEbReH94yDQ07V4O848C5J7F5JjZslhGekKVjq0eT3T7PmIibJfii391tqgYUBHIg/jpY2LifxzgrHW5jaFRzrsIZNuCiBF1M4lUjSORF01aPgT68s1vHcG/+r0LE8EsCsHRT9VDvKl0F6ntgwoTUY/OSqONCbkzE2wfWsy5jGGV3YN8jCkMYIWi7FylgpCrMbb99DfNIKRA37GpvoLx08+X8YPbBRHoL1Gs3JGIi91UBAMQ=="
}
---
```

<br />

Then we have our vault configured (it is just a Genserver giving us encrypt/decrypt capabilities given a particular key), that will be this particular module:
```elixir
defmodule Tr.Vault do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is responsible for interfacing with the vault
  """
  use Cloak.Vault, otp_app: :tr

  @impl GenServer
  def init(config) do
    config =
      Keyword.put(config, :ciphers,
        default: {
          Cloak.Ciphers.AES.GCM,
          tag: "AES.GCM.V1", key: decode_env!("CLOAK_KEY"), iv_length: 12
        }
      )

    {:ok, config}
  end

  defp decode_env!(var) do
    var
    |> System.get_env()
    |> Base.decode64!()
  end
end
```

Then to keep rate-limits at hand every 5 minutes I'm polling GitHub GraphQL API to fetch the list of sponsors and
caching that in the local DB:
```elixir
defmodule Tr.Sponsors do
  @moduledoc """
  Basic task to fetch the list of sponsors from GitHub
  """
  @app :tr

  defp load_app do
    Application.load(@app)
  end

  defp start_app do
    load_app()
    Application.ensure_all_started(@app)
  end

  @doc """
  """
  def start do
    start_app()

    # account for more than a 100 sponsors
    sponsors = get_sponsors(100)

    Enum.each(get_in(sponsors, ["data", "user", "sponsors", "nodes"]), fn sponsor ->
      Tr.SponsorsCache.add_or_update(sponsor)
    end)
  end

  @doc """
    # Example output:

    %Neuron.Response{
      body: %{
        "data" => %{
          "user" => %{
            "sponsors" => %{
              "nodes" => [
                %{"login" => "nnnnnnn"},
                %{"login" => "xxxxxxx"},
                %{...},
                ...
              ],
              "totalCount" => 123
            }
          }
        }
      }
  """
  def get_sponsors(limit) do
    token = System.get_env("GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN")

    {:ok, body} =
      Neuron.query(
        "{ user(login:\"kainlite\") { ... on Sponsorable { sponsors(first: #{limit}) { totalCount
      nodes { ... on User { login } ... on Organization { login } } } } } }",
        %{},
        url: "https://api.github.com/graphql",
        headers: [authorization: "Bearer #{token}"]
      )

    body.body
  end
end
```
<br />

The last step would be to just decrypt and render the content:
```elixir
    <%= cond do %>
      <% @post.sponsored && @current_user && Tr.SponsorsCache.sponsor?(@current_user.github_username) -> %>
        <br />
        <p>
          <iframe
            width="100%"
            height="800px"
            src={decrypt(@post.video)}
            title=""
            frameBorder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowFullScreen
          >
          </iframe>
        </p>
        <br />
        <%= raw(Earmark.as_html!(decrypt(@post.encrypted_content))) %>
    ...
    ...
```
<br />

At a high level that's what it looks like, are you interested in learning more about this or the approach taken here?
