##### **Introduction**
In this article we will explore different alternatives for spinning up a cluster locally for testing, practicing or just developing an application.

The source code and/or documentation of the projects that we will be testing are listed here:
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* [Kubernetes the hard way using vagrant](https://github.com/kainlite/kubernetes-the-easy-way-with-vagrant)
* [Kubernetes with kubeadm using vagrant](https://github.com/kainlite/kubernetes-the-easy-way-with-vagrant-and-kubeadm)

There are more alternatives like [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.

If you want to give it a try to each one make sure to follow their recommended way of install or your distro/system way.

The first two (minikube and kind) we will see how to configure a CNI plugin in order to be able to use [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/), in the other two environments you can customize everything and these are best for learning rather than for daily usage but if you have enough ram you could do that as well.

We will be using the following pods and network policy to test that it works, we will create 3 pods, 1 client and 2 app backends, one backend will be listening in port TCP/1111 and the other in the port TCP/2222, in our netpolicy we will only allow our client to connect to app1:
```elixir

##### Minikube
Minikube is heavily used but it can be too heavy sometimes, in any case we will see an example of making it work with network policies, the good thing is that it has a lot of documentation because a lot of people use it and it is updated often:
```elixir
‚ùØ minikube start --cni=cilium --memory=4096
üòÑ  minikube v1.15.1 on Arch rolling
    ‚ñ™ MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD=minikube
‚ú®  Automatically selected the docker driver
üëç  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
üî•  Creating docker container (CPUs=2, Memory=4096MB) ...
üê≥  Preparing Kubernetes v1.19.4 on Docker 19.03.13 ...
üîó  Configuring Cilium (Container Networking Interface) ...
üîé  Verifying Kubernetes components...
üåü  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
üèÑ  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default

```

###### Give it a couple of minutes to start, for new versions of minikube you can install it like this, otherwise you can specify that you will install the CNI plugin and then just install the manifests.
```elixir
‚ùØ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   cilium-c5bf8                       0/1     Running    0          59s
kube-system   cilium-operator-5d8498fc44-hpzbk   1/1     Running    0          59s
kube-system   coredns-f9fd979d6-qs2m8            1/1     Running    0          3m46s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running    0          3m54s
...

```

###### Then let's validate that it works
```elixir
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f netpol-example.yaml
pod/client configured
pod/app1 configured
pod/app2 configured
service/app1 created
service/app2 created
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/default-network-policy created

‚ùØ kubectl exec pod/client -- nc -v -z app1 1111
app1 (10.103.109.255:1111) open

‚ùØ kubectl exec pod/client -- timeout 5 nc -v -z app2 2222
punt!
command terminated with exit code 143

‚ùØ kubectl exec pod/client -- nc -v -z app2 2222 -w 5
nc: app2 (10.97.248.246:2222): Connection timed out
command terminated with exit code 1
```

Note that we add the timeout command with 5 seconds wait so we don't have to really wait for nc timeout which by default is no timeout, we also tested with nc timeout.

You can get more info for minikube using Cilium on their [docs](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.9/gettingstarted/minikube/)

###### Remember to clean up
```elixir
‚ùØ minikube delete
üî•  Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
üî•  Deleting container "minikube" ...
üî•  Removing /home/kainlite/.minikube/machines/minikube ...
üíÄ  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.

```

##### KIND
KIND is really lightweight and fast, I usually test and develop using KIND the main reason is that almost everything works like in a real cluster but it has no overhead, it's simple to install and easy to run, first we need to put this config in place to tell kind not to use it's default CNI.
```elixir
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
networking:
  disableDefaultCNI: true # disable kindnet
  podSubnet: 192.168.0.0/16 # set to Calico's default subnet
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 30000
    hostPort: 30000
    listenAddress: "0.0.0.0" # Optional, defaults to "0.0.0.0"
    protocol: tcp # Optional, defaults to tcp
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker

```

Then we can create the cluster and install calico (there is a small gotcha here, you need to check that the calico node pods come up if not kill them and they should come up and everything will start working normally, this is due to the environment variable that gets added after the deployment for it to work with KIND):
```elixir
‚ùØ kind create cluster --config kind-calico.yaml
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.18.2) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

```

##### Kubeadm and vagrant
This is an interesting scenario and it's great to understand how clusters are configured using kubeadm also to practice things such as adding/removing/upgrading the nodes, backup and restore etcd, etc. if you want to test this one clone this repo: [Kubernetes with kubeadm using vagrant](https://github.com/kainlite/kubernetes-the-easy-way-with-vagrant-and-kubeadm)
```elixir
‚ùØ ./up.sh
Bringing machine 'cluster1-master1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
Bringing machine 'cluster1-worker1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
Bringing machine 'cluster1-worker2' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> cluster1-master1: Importing base box 'ubuntu/bionic64'...
==> cluster1-master1: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> cluster1-master1: Setting the name of the VM: cluster1-master1
==> cluster1-master1: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> cluster1-master1: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
...
...
...
...
    cluster1-worker2: This node has joined the cluster:
    cluster1-worker2: * Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
    cluster1-worker2: * The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.
    cluster1-worker2:
    cluster1-worker2: Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.

###### Next, lets copy the kubeconfig and deploy our resources then test (this deployment is using weave)
```elixir
‚ùØ vagrant ssh cluster1-master1 -c "sudo cat /root/.kube/config" > vagrant-kubeconfig
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.

‚ùØ export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/vagrant-kubeconfig"

pod/client created
pod/app1 created
pod/app2 created
service/app1 created
service/app2 created

```

###### Test it (wait until the pods are in ready state)
```elixir
‚ùØ kubectl exec pod/client -- nc -v -z app1 1111
app1 (10.97.203.229:1111) open

‚ùØ kubectl exec pod/client -- nc -v -z app2 2222 -w 5
nc: app2 (10.108.254.138:2222): Connection timed out
command terminated with exit code 1

```

###### For more info refer to the readme in the repo and the scripts in there, it should be straight forward to follow and reproduce, remember to clean up:
```elixir
‚ùØ ./down.sh
==> cluster1-worker2: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> cluster1-worker2: Destroying VM and associated drives...
==> cluster1-worker1: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> cluster1-worker1: Destroying VM and associated drives...
==> cluster1-master1: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> cluster1-master1: Destroying VM and associated drives...

```

##### Kubernetes the hard way and vagrant
This is probably the most complex scenario and it's purely educational you get to generate all the certificates by hand basically and configure everything by yourself (see the original repo for instructions in how to do that in gcloud if you are interested), if you want to test this one clone this repo: [Kubernetes the hard way using vagrant](https://github.com/kainlite/kubernetes-the-easy-way-with-vagrant), but be patient and ready to debug if something doesn't go well.
